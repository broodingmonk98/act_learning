first.py is the main file from where other modules are called. 

Different active learners are implemented via separate classes.

For doing tradeoff experiments, run the application via the command " python first.py tradeoff active_learning_method" where the active_learning_method will be replaced by minmax, minsum, minmin, maxquery, minmaxvar or random.

For each of the active selection techniques separate classes are written inside active_learners.py file. 

Learners.py contains all the functionalities which are common for all active learning techniques. 

PDSparse folder contains the pdsparse code which is used by a wrapper module in learners.py file.

min_max_l2distance contains scalable code of active learning for minmax approach which we discarded later.
